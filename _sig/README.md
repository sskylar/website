# Special Interest Group (SIG)

In 2012, Linaro began to form Segment Groups that focused on new areas beyond the original mobile focus of Linaro's collaborative engineering. These groups have multiplied and grown and there are often specialist areas within the groups that are of specific interest to some of the members and potentially outside companies, but which are not of enough interest to the whole group to merit the investment of shared resources. To enable work to progress in those area, Linaro decided to allow the formation of Special Interest Groups (SIGs) inside the Segment Groups. The first of these - the High Performance Compute (HPC) SIG was formed in March 2017 in the Linaro Enterprise Group (LEG).

If companies are interested in becoming members of Linaro and forming segment groups or SIGs, please do not hesitate to contact us with the form below.
