Membership of Linaro is open to all interested companies, including Arm licensees, device companies using Arm processors, Linux distributions and other companies who wish to influence the future of Linux on Arm. Core, Club and Group members all provide funding for Linaro and engineering assignees. To learn more about our membership please see: [Membership Rules of Linaro](/assets/pdf/Membership_Rules_of_Linaro_Limited_Effective_26th_July_20122.pdf) and the [Articles of Association](/assets/pdf/Linaro-Articles-of-Association-New-June-2010.pdf).

The current members are listed below. If you are interested in joining these industry leaders, please contact Joe Bates at [contactus@linaro.org](mailto:contactus@linaro.org).


# Core Members

Core membership is the highest level within Linaro. Core members have a seat on the Linaro board of directors, two votes on the Technical Steering Committee (TSC) and unlimited access to all of Linaro’s activities.

{% for member in core_members %}

</div>
{% endfor %}

# Club Members

Club membership is the starting point for most of Arm’s licensees who produce chips in a range of segments. There is one voted representative of the Club members on the Linaro board of directors and each Club member has one vote on the TSC.

{% assign core_members = site.data.members["club_members"] | sort: 'name' %}

# Group Members

Group members have a vote on their group steering committee and an elected representative on the TSC. Group membership is a good way for companies with a focus in a particular segment to get involved and influence the direction of Linaro’s work in that segment. There are currently five segment groups at Linaro: [Linaro Enterprise Group (LEG)](#leg), [Linaro Home Group (LHG)](#lhg), [Linaro Mobile Group (LMG)](#lmg), [Linaro Networking Group (LNG)](#lng) and our newest group – [Linaro Community Board Group (LCG)](https://www.96boards.org). Below are the lists of the members of each respective group.

# High Performance Computing (HPC)

The HPC SIG was officially launched at Linaro Connect Las Vegas in September 2016 to drive the adoption of ARM in HPC through the creation of a data center ecosystem. It is a collaborative project comprised of members and an advisory board. Current members include ARM, HiSilicon, Qualcomm, Fujitsu, Cavium, Red Hat and HPE. CERN and Riken are on the advisory board.

# 96boards

96Boards is the first open hardware specification that provides a platform for the delivery of compatible low-cost, small footprint 32-bit and 64-bit Cortex-A boards. Corporate members of Linaro provide funding and engineers plus direction through various steering committees. Resources are split into semi-autonomous groups with their own members. LCG is one of these groups and its member companies contribute to the development of the 96Boards specification, the maintenance of the 96Boards website and support for the software builds for their compatible boards. LCG membership is required for 96Boards certification.

Because this group is all about ecosystem development and encouraging the production of add-on products, there are also opportunities for companies to participate as partners who engage in board manufacturing, board distribution and/or add-on product distribution and manufacturing.
