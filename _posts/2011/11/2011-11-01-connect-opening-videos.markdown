Orlando, Florida, Oct. 31 2011

Stephen Doel, Linaro's Chief Operating Officer, opened the Linaro Connect Q4.11 event. In particular, he gave practical details to participants.

This first video should also interest Linaro community members who could be interested in joining a future Linaro Connect event. It gives you an overview of what Connect events bring in terms of technical and human experience.

Christian Reis, Linaro's Engineering VP, went on by setting technical goals for the week. He was then followed by the leaders of each of the working groups ("tech leads"), which shared their team's goals for this intense working and networking week!

For people who follow Connect remotely, this second video can be useful to know what current Linaro plans are, and what sessions they may be interested in joining. For people interested in joining future Connect events, it also gives details about how work gets done during such events.

These were just early videos shot by myself with my amateur camcorder. The same sessions were also recorded by NovaCut, a company which will produce more professional video and photo shots. 

I will continue to post more Connect videos in the next days. Stay tuned on [Twitter LinaroConnect](http://twitter.com/linaroconnect/) and on [YouTube LinaroOrg](http://youtube.com/linaroorg), where the individual videos will be released and announced first.
