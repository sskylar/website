The Linaro Toolchain Working Group is pleased to announce the release of Linaro QEMU 2011.10.

Linaro QEMU 2011.10 is the latest monthly release of qemu-linaro. Based off upstream (trunk) QEMU, it includes a number of ARM-focused bug fixes and enhancements.

New in this month's release:
* Instructions introduced with the Cortex-A15 (ARM mode SDIV and UDIV, and the VFPv4 fused multiply-accumulate instructions VFMA, VFMS, VFNMA, VFNMS) are now supported in linux-user mode
* Beagle models now support USB networking (run the model with "-usb -device usb-net,netdev=mynet -netdev user,id=mynet")

Known issues:
* There may be some problems with running multithreaded programs in linux-user mode (LP: [#823902]())
