The 11.09 Release Candidate 2 is out!

This is the second 11.09 Android release candidate. Each build has been built with the official Linaro 4.6 toolchain release: [https://android-build.linaro.org/builds/~linaro-android/toolchain-4.6-2011.09/]()

We track the tip toolchain which allowed us to release an update nearly co-incident with the toolchain group's official 11.09 release.
