The Linaro Toolchain Working Group is pleased to announce the release of Linaro QEMU 2011.09.

Linaro QEMU 2011.09 is the latest monthly release of qemu-linaro. Based off upstream (trunk) QEMU, it includes a number of ARM-focused bug fixes and enhancements.

New in this month's release:
- linux-user mode now supports the 64 bit cmpxchg kernel helpers  (only needed for applications compiled for ARMv6 or lower)
- PL111 display controller now supported; this fixes a problem where BGR was interpreted as RGB on recent versatilepb kernels

Plus a few other minor bug fixes and the usual round of upstream fixes and improvements.

Known issues:
- The beagle and beaglexm models still do not support USB networking; we intend to fix this for the 2011.10 release
- There may be some problems with running multithreaded programs in linux-user mode ([LP:823902](http://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/823902))
