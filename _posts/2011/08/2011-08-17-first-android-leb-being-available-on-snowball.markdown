title: First Android LEB available on Snowball
---

Another quarter has passed, another face-to-face summit is ongoing within Linaro and the team has once again impressive achievements to show!

At ST-Ericsson we are particularly excited about the availability of the latest 3.0 Linux kernel on Snowball - fully integrated in the LAVA environment too!

Not enough?

Let's add then the first Android LEB being available on Snowball, not only based on the 3.0 kernel but also built with the 4.6 GCC toolchain. A "world first" from all points of view.

This is once again confirming that Linaro is delivering value to its members in line with its mission: the latest Linux kernel, the latest tools, optimized for the latest ARM cores and fully validated on the latest hardware from its members.

Simply awesome!

Congratulations to the ST-Ericsson Landing Team!
