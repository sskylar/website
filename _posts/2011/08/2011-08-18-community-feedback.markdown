The Engineering Resources team is trying to solicit feedback from the community. Our goal is to make it as easy as possible for you to get your job done. With that in mind, we'd like to check in with you and get your thoughts on what hasn't worked well for you.

This is intended to be an open-ended question. However, here are some specifics to help get you going:

  1. What were the biggest obstacles you faced when you started?


  2. What are the biggest obstacles you face now?


  3. How do go about getting help? What format do you prefer it in (websites, videos, etc).


Feel free to comment here, or send me an email (andy.doan@linaro.org)
