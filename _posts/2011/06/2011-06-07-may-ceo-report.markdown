Earlier this month we held our Developer Summit in Budapest, alongside the Ubuntu Developer Summit.  This was our biggest event yet, with around 200 Linaro-affiliated attendees. Thank you to everyone who participated. One purpose of the summit is to take the technical requirements from the Technical Steering Committee (TSC) and turn them into “Blueprints” which define a specification for the work items to be carried out. Rather than try to plan 6 months of work at a time, this time around we are focusing on the next 3 months, and we then plan to carry out a combination of specification definition alongside coding sessions at our next event in August, in Cambourne UK. This should provide more flexibility to react to market changes and new priorities from our members as they arise.

Highlights of the developer summit were the [Linaro Showcase evening](/blog/highlights-from-linaro-technical-showcase/), where we had 20 stands from Linaro and other companies showing Linaro-related technology. The developer summit also included a number of mini-summits and discussions on embedded memory management (see the April Executive Update for further details), power management and ARM Linux kernel maintainership (see this month’s Technical Topic section below). I am particularly encouraged by the participation of many companies in the ARM ecosystem outside our current membership in our activities. Linaro is being seen as the place where the ARM SoC vendors can come together to work on problems that will offer mutual benefit, and I hope that this will encourage more SoC vendors to join us.

As more of our members focus on Android, I have been asked whether this should become Linaro’s sole focus. While Android is gaining increasing importance in Linaro, I believe strongly that we need to continue to work closely within the key upstream projects, and particularly on the kernel and toolchain, in order to be able to provide long term support within multiple Linux distributions for our members. Google themselves build new versions of Android with a starting point of the upstream kernel; this remains a key part of Linaro’s work. We also see SoC customers in significant markets such as IVI and home (STB, DTV, gateways etc.) using other distributions based on the mainstream [kernel.org](http://kernel.org/). Our goal is to be distribution agnostic, while recognizing that distributions of key importance to our members will achieve Linaro Evaluation Build status, and will be supported with regular releases, testing on the LAVA framework, and maintenance.
