Wow! Talk about having everything at the same place! Redwood City has for the past two weeks harbored a unique concentration of Linux and Android Professionals (I almost wrote "geeks" :)) At Connect we planned the next quarter of Linaro work while on the same time got a lot of work done. At Android Builders Summit we met fellow Android people, some of them as far away from as outside the ARM universe :) and got more work done. At Embedded Linux Conference we worked some more and mingled with the superstars of Linux. Intense!

Here's a list of this weeks major achievements.
