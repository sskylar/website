Less than 24 hours after Android 4.0.4 appeared on Google's servers, we're pleased to announce the availability of a Linaro-ified Android 4.0.4. (This is not an official release - it's the beginning of the 12.04 builds.)

The complete source is available in our [git repository](http://android.git.linaro.org/gitweb) - in linaro_android_4.0.4 branches in subprojects containing modifications by Linaro, or using the android-4.0.4_r1.1 tag in subprojects using unmodified code from AOSP.

To get a complete Linaro Android 4.0.4 build, run

```bash

    repo init -u git://android.git.linaro.org/platform/manifest.git -b linaro_android_4.0.4 -m BUILDTYPE.xml
    repo sync

```

Where BUILDTYPE is the build type you want to use (which build type you want to use depends primarily on your target hardware) - one of landing-panda, landing-snowball, staging-iMX53, staging-iMX6, staging-origen, staging-panda, staging-vexpress-a9, staging-vexpress-rtsm, tracking-origen, tracking-panda or tracking-snowball.

Binary builds will appear shortly on [android-build](https://releases.linaro.org/).

Of course, another, even faster, way to get 404 is just going [here](https://releases.linaro.org/). ;-)
