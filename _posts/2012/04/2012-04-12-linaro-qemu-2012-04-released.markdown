The Linaro Toolchain Working Group is pleased to announce the release of Linaro QEMU 2012.04.

Linaro QEMU 2012.04 is the latest monthly release of qemu-linaro. Based off upstream (trunk) QEMU, it includes a number of ARM-focused bug fixes and enhancements.

New in this month's release:

  * ppoll syscall now supported in ARM linux-user mode

  * the SETEND instruction in the Thumb encoding now UNDEFs to match behaviour for the ARM encoding

  * the OMAP36xx UART FIFO status registers are now implemented (thanks to Jan Vesely)

Known issues:

  * Graphics do not work for OMAP3 based models (beagle, overo) with 11.10 Linaro images.

  * Audio may not work on Versatile Express models with the latest Linaro kernel/hardware packs ([LP: #977610](http://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/977610)).
