Linaro Connect (LCE 12) will take place at the [Bella Center]()https://booking.bellasky.dk/reserve?lang=en&getAvailability=1&Arrival=2012-10-28&Departure=2012-11-01&BlockCode=LINARO in Copenhagen Denmark on 29 Oct to 2 Nov 2012.  [Registration](http://connect.linaro.org/wp-login.php?redirect_to=/register-connect/) for this event is [now open](http://connect.linaro.org/wp-login.php?redirect_to=/register-connect/) and those who will be attending are encouraged to register earlier.  In addition to the regular track sessions—Android, Graphics and multimedia, Kernel, Platform (Ubuntu and generic Linux), Power, QA/Infrastructure, Tools, Training and Validation/LAVA—this Linaro Connect event in Copenhagen will host three (3) mini summits.

Those mini-summits—tracks focused on a single strategic topic held on a single day to be held from 8.30am until lunchtime— include an Android, ARMv8 (64-bit) and a big.LITTLE mini-summit. These summits are schedule to be held on the Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday of Linaro Connect. (The [schedule](http://connect.linaro.org/resources/#schedule) is subject to change and still being finalized, so check the [Linaro Connect website](http://connect.linaro.org/resources/) for updated information.)

Earlier this week, I had the opportunity [to speak](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sov5c2FSlkc&feature=plcp) with our CTO, [David Rusling](/about/) about the ARMv8 and big.LITTLE mini-summits, our chat [was recorded](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sov5c2FSlkc&feature=plcp) and you [can watch](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sov5c2FSlkc&feature=plcp) as David sums up, describes and gives insight as to why these summits are so important.

[Linaro Connect](http://connect.linaro.org/resources/#welcome), as its name suggests is for "connecting"! This event gives over 200 participants who range from kernel hackers to integration engineers to ARM SoC industry executives to gather for a week to present, discuss and develop features,  infrastructure and optimizations for the Linux kernel, Android, Ubuntu and more.

If you want to get involved with [Linaro](/), its [members](/members), [partners](/members/) and [community](/leg/) then [register today](http://connect.linaro.org/wp-login.php?redirect_to=/register-connect/) to "Connect" with engineers and managers who collaboratively decide on the direction and future of Linux on ARM. This event will also allow you or your organization to [make the world aware](http://connect.linaro.org/resources/#socializing) of your work in the Linux on ARM ecosystem.

Remember, if you want to have fun while helping shape the future of Linux on ARM then [join us](http://connect.linaro.org/resources/#welcome) at [The Bella Center](http://connect.linaro.org/resources/#location) in Copenhagen, Denmark in October!
