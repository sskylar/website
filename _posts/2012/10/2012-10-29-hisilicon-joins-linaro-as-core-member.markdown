SHENZHEN, CHINA AND CAMBRIDGE, UK - 29 OCT 2012

Wireless communication chipset solutions provider HiSilicon Technologies Co., Ltd., and Linaro, the not-for-profit engineering organization developing open source software for the ARM architecture, today announced that HiSilicon has joined Linaro as a core member.

HiSilicon will appoint a representative to the board of Linaro and work with other members to develop the future of Linux on ARM. The company will contribute resources to work together with the engineers from other Linaro members. In addition to joining the board of Linaro, HiSilicon will join the Technical Steering Committee (TSC), which directs the shared Linaro engineering team of over 100 engineers.

Linaro has a unique business model where multiple companies create core open source software once with a shared investment in a single software engineering team, rather than by creating multiple, fragmented software solutions in isolation. Membership delivers an immediate return on investment as new members get immediate access to a significant engineering team.

We recognize the importance of working together with other companies to efficiently generate shared solutions that provide a platform for innovation, increased differentiation and faster time to market.” said Teresa He, President of HiSilicon. “HiSilicon has long recognized the importance of software development and LInaro presents a unique oppoortunity for us to share both our own experience and the experience of the other LInaro members to develop highly competitive, innovative products.

"We are extremely pleased to welcome HiSilicon as a Linaro member," said George Grey, Linaro CEO, "HiSilicon is a leading chipset provider in many sectors with the need to deploy open source software in more and more products, from telecom networks to consumer electronics. We look forward to adding HiSilicon software engineers to our global team working on the delivery of core Linux software for the ARM architecture.
