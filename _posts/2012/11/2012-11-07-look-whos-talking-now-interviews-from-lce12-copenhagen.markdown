There is never a shortage of people to interview at the Linaro Connect events and LCE12-Copenhagen and UDS-R were no different.  However; finding time in people's schedules often prove to be a challenge, but I was able to track a few Linaro people down and discuss demo's, mini-summits, changes, challenges and more.

As always it was a pleasure to work with Form AV folks and all of the staff at UDS. Many thanks to everyone for the opportunity to conduct these interviews and I look forward to the follow-up ones over the next few weeks.
