The Linaro Toolchain Working Group is pleased to announce the release of Linaro QEMU 2012.01.

Linaro QEMU 2012.01 is the latest monthly release of qemu-linaro. Based off upstream (trunk) QEMU, it includes a number of ARM-focused bug fixes and enhancements.

New in this month's release:

  * Several bug fixes which reinstate support for running on ARM hosts


  * Support for previously missing \*xattr syscalls in usermode emulation


  * A (dummy) model of the L2x0/PL310 L2 cache contrnoller (thanks to Rob Herring and Mark Langsdorf of Calxeda)

Known issues:


  * Graphics do not work for OMAP3 based models (beagle, overo) with 11.10 Linaro images.
