The [Linaro Connect](http://connect.linaro.org/) Budapest 2017 (BUD17) marked the 21st Linaro Connect since 2010.  Linaro Connect Budapest was a five-day event with over 400 attendees and was packed full of keynotes by industry leaders, talks, training, meetings, hacking and a lot of socializing fun. It is the conference for anyone interested in Linux development and related ecosystems on ARM and brings together the best and the brightest of the Linux on ARM community. The first day of the event began with a keynote by Linaro's CEO, George Grey and many announcements. First was the announcement that [Google has joined as a club member ](/news/google-becomes-club-member-linaro/)with Linaro. Then was the announcement that [Fujitsu will be collaborating with Linaro ](/news/linaro-announces-fujitsus-collaboration-accelerate-high-performance-computing-arm/)to accelerate High Performance Computing on ARM. Next was [HXT Semiconductor joining Linaro ](/news/hxt-semiconductor-joins-linaro-accelerate-advanced-server-development-arm/)to work on accelerating Advanced Server Development on ARM. Finally George announced that [Acer joined Linaro’s IoT and Embedded group](/news/acer-joins-linaro-iot-and-embedded-group/), which is focused on delivering end to end open source reference software for more secure connected products.

The week of sessions included many different tracks that attendees could attend, with each day focused on a particular segment within Linaro. Along with all the sessions and hacking there was also the traditional demo Friday that was held to showcase all the hard work that was done by the various teams over the last several months. Attendees were able to enjoy lunch while wandering the exhibit hall full of demos by both Linaro and it's member companies.

One of the highlights of the week was the Thursday night Linaro Gala where attendees had some time to socialize and get to know each other while enjoying games, drinks and dinner. It was also an opportunity to recognize some outstanding contributions to Linaro.


## **Keynotes During the Week**

**Monday:**

On Monday the [Welcome keynote](http://connect.linaro.org/resource/bud17/bud17-100k1/) was given by Linaro’s CEO, George Grey, who welcomed attendees to the event and gave an overview of the many projects that Linaro is working on with its member companies. George then went on to demo several of these projects.

**Tuesday:**

Christophe Arviset, who is Head of the Data and Engineering Division at ESA’s European Space Astronomy Centre (ESAC) in Spain. Christophe gave a keynote titled: Big data, big challenges for ESA Space Science Missions’ Archives. The keynote discussed the European Space Agency’s (ESA) current mission Gaia and upcoming one Euclid that will generate massive amounts of astronomical data will need to be made freely available on-line through powerful data management systems. This brings big challenges for building these missions’ archives.  [Watch the keynote](http://connect.linaro.org/resource/bud17/bud17-200k1/)

* * *



**Friday:**

Jonathan Corbet, who is a kernel documentation maintainer and co-founder of LWN.net, gave a keynote titled: The kernel’s limits to growth. He discussed the number of process and community-management hurdles that had to be overcome to make the Linux kernel one of the most successful software-development projects ever. He went on to talk about the number of obstacles they still face, and that beyond limiting our future growth, might even threaten our ability to sustain our current development pace. He talked about the obstacles, and how they can be addressed. [Watch the keynote](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hajkHgyVbk)

    * The TI SimpleLink CC32xx family of MCUs provides an SoC and supporting SDK which completely offloads the WiFi stack onto an integrated network coprocessor. The SimpleLink SDK currently has no explicit support for the Zephyr IoT OS, but is designed to be portable. A native IP stack for Zephyr is currently under development, which includes an experimental IP offload option. This session reviews the challenges of integrating a vendor TCP/IP offload engine into an existing OS IP stack in general, and in particular, evaluates options for integrating the TI SimpleLink WiFi stack into Zephyr.

    * Adding support for IEEE 802.15.4 and 6LoWPAN to an embedded Linux system opens up new possibilities to communicate with tiny devices. The mainline kernel
supports the wireless protocols to connect such devices to the internet, acting as border router for such networks. This talk will show the current kernel support, how to enable and configure the subsystems to use it and how to communicate between Linux and IoT operating systems like RIOT, Contiki or Zephyr.

  * **The Swarm on the Edge: Pushing “IoT” to the next step - BUD17-303**
    * Sensory swarms of an IoT can be wirelessly interconnected to interact with the edge of a cloud, and offer an unprecedented ability to monitor and act on a range of evolving physical quantities. The Swarm leverages the paradigm of independent, cross-niche and heterogeneous devices that can cooperate with each other in order to execute tasks synergistically. The Swarm architecture is device-oriented, focused on machine-to-machine communications. The Heterogeneous Broker is responsible for dynamically recruiting resources from the cloud; allowing information aggregation to make or aid decisions; and then to dynamically recruit actuation resources. In this talk we will describe our experience implementing and deploying the heterogeneous broker developed by USP in partnership with UC Berkeley. An special focus will be given to the 96Boards program.

  * **A functional Open GPU Upon ARM - BUD17-502**
    * GPGPUs (General Purpose Graphics Processing Unit) are becoming a relevant functional block on SoCs, particularly on the ARM ecosystem. Extracting full performance of a GPU is now becoming a combination of well integrated and optimized software and hardware. Motivated by that, there are many Open GPU initiatives around the world using FPGAs, but most (if not all) of these are on Intel platforms. This project aims to present an Open GPU based on an FPGA using the ARM Instruction Set. The driver platform adopted was the well know MESA 3D (www.mesa3d.org). We will describe the co-design approach to designing the OpenGPU. A functional demonstration of the OpenGPU working on a range of OpenGl applications ported by Linaro will be shown. On the fly we will change drivers between: SW only, GPU on Asic, and OpenGPU to see its performance impact. The engineers that implemented this system will be at the session to support detailed technical questions.

  * **Partnership in Open Design and Manufacturing: How Universities can Contribute with Developers Communities - BUD17-511**
    * The University of Sao Paulo, with support of LSITEC (an NGO Design House), has all of the necessary equipment to design and manufacture 96boards computers and mezzanine boards. Working with one of Linaro’s partners, LeMaker, LSITEC has produced the LeMaker Guitar single board computer under license, and is now looking forward to producing 96boards and accessories the same way. The final goal is to strengthen the gap between industry and universities, producing professionals with high design skills in embedding computing to society, while providing to Linaro and its partners the ability to have high quality boards in various volumes of manufacturing.
