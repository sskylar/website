## Telecoms and networking leader ZTE joins Linaro to promote global development of open source software


CAMBRIDGE, UK - 18 MAR 2014

Linaro Ltd, the not-for-profit engineering organization developing open source software for the ARM® architecture, today announced that ZTE Corporation has joined Linaro as a Club Member.

ZTE Corporation (“ZTE”) (H share stock code: 0763.HK / A share stock code: 000063.SZ) is a publicly-listed global provider of telecommunications equipment, network solutions and mobile devices. ZTE has joined Linaro at the same time as three other mobile industry leaders, bringing membership of the not-for-profit organization to a total of 29 companies.

“I welcome ZTE joining Linaro as a club member. Their experience in wireless and networking will help us in our technical and strategic discussions,” said David Rusling, CTO Linaro. “At the recent Linaro Connect in Macau, we started to work together on new technologies, built around the 64-bit ARMv8-A architecture as well as initiatives such as Linaro's Long-term Supported Kernel (LSK). LSK is a key delivery mechanism for both ARMv7-A and ARMv8-A. As well as supporting operating systems such as Android and Firefox OS, LSK allows us to pull together and demonstrate advanced kernel features that are needed for products now and in the future."

ZTE has a strong track record demonstrating commitment to open source technology development. As early as 2002 – six years before the first Android smartphone – ZTE introduced a Linux-based smartphone and it was one of the early members of Google’s Open Handset Alliance (OHA). The company is also a long-term member of the Linux Foundation, receiving Carrier Grade Linux (CGL) 5.0 accreditation in 2012.

“We are honored to become a Club Member of Linaro,” said Jill Guo, Director of Strategic Partnerships at ZTE. “ZTE is committed to working with Linaro and other open source communities to accelerate the development of technologies on the ARM platform. The collaboration with Linaro will cover the development of a comprehensive range of ZTE products, including mobile devices, servers, Core Network products, Internet Protocol Television and SmartHome.”
