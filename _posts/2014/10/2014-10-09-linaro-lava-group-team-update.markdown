  * **LCU14-409: BoF - Kernel Testing Made Easy**
    * Session Summary
Testing is like ice cream, there is always room for more. We can always use more testing to make sure the kernel does what it needs to. Unfortunately it is often not easy to test the kernel without doing a bunch of setup of environment and getting the correct tools. This session discusses ways of making kernel tests easy to run without requiring a lot of effort. Gaurav Minocha discussed the Google Summer of Code project on making the in-kernel device tree unit tests easier to run, and Grant Likely led a discussion on ways we can make kernel testing as easy as typing "make test".
