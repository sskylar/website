Cambridge, UK; 3 August 2015

Linaro Ltd, the collaborative engineering organization developing open source software for the ARM® architecture, today announced that Meizu Technology Company Ltd has become the first OEM to join the Linaro Mobile Group (LMG).

LMG was formed in July 2014 to consolidate and optimize open source software for ARM powered mobile phones, tablets, laptops and wearables. The Group's engineers work on the Android Open Source Project (AOSP), Performance and Power optimizations, Graphics and GPGPU, and work closely with other groups in Linaro Core Engineering on other open source technologies. Meizu's membership of LMG is significant because it can directly represent the needs of today's mobile phone manufacturer in a group that includes silicon and software vendors.

“We are delighted to welcome Meizu as the first pure OEM handset maker to become a member of the Linaro Mobile Group”, said Joe Bates, EVP of Linaro Member Services. “As a current and potential customer of several of Linaro’s silicon supplier members, Meizu will take on a unique role in helping define the engineering activities of LMG and our contributions to open source projects in the mobile space.”

“Meizu designs and produces smartphones that provide a simple, intuitive mobile experience” said Liang Dongming, CTO of Meizu. “Open source software is critical to enabling Meizu to provide this experience built on a proven technology foundation and we are committed to working with Linaro and its members worldwide to accelerate open source innovation on the ARM platform.”
