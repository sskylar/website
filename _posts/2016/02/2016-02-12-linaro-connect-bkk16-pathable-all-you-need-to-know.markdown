## Going to BKK16? You will need to know Pathable


Linaro Connect BKK16 is just around the corner and we are expecting another great event. There will be daily keynotes given by several industry leaders, numerous interesting sessions that attendees will want to participate in, afternoon hacking and a lot of meetings. So how do you keep track of everything happening each day? You will need to logon to the very easy to use Pathable event schedule system. 

Pathable allows attendees to see the daily schedule of all activities, select just the ones they would like to attend, schedule meetings, have discussions with other attendees and receive important notices of any changes or additions to the schedule. It is also where all the content for each session will be posted first, so any links to presentations or videos will be posted under each session as soon as they are available. 

This site will be the place to help you get the most out of your time at Linaro Connect BKK16 so it is really important that you:


  1. Go to the site and login prior to the event


  2. Set-up your profile and become familiar with the site and how it works


  3. There will be a “mobile app” available for you to install from the app store to access the community. This will be coming shortly. We will let attendees know as soon as this is available.


**Below are some steps to help get you started:**

**Step 1:** Go to the pathable site: [**https://bkk16.pathable.com/**](https://bkk16.pathable.com/)

**Step 2:** Login – If you have [registered for Linaro Connect BKK16](http://connect.linaro.org/attend/) you should have received an email from pathable after 12 February with your login details. This email was entitled: “Please join Linaro Connect Bangkok 2016″. If you cannot find this email please send an email to: connect@linaro.org

**Step 3:** Once you get logged in – You will want to update your profile page so that other attendees know who you are, as well as set-up your password to something you can remember easily. 

**Step 4:** Add Tags to your profile to identify teams you work with or areas you are interested in. You can see a list of the current tags being used by going to: Attendees>Tags (in the left hand drop down), but you can add your own as well. When people perform a “search” in the attendees or members list, they will be able to choose from the networking interests and tags you and the rest of the community have added to their profiles.

**Step 5:** Review the current schedule [https://bkk16.pathable.com/meetings](https://bkk16.pathable.com/meetings) and add sessions you would like to attend to your schedule [https://bkk16.pathable.com/meetings/my](https://bkk16.pathable.com/meetings/my).
