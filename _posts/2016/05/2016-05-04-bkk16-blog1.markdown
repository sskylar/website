Linaro Connect Bangkok (BKK16) was our 19th event to date and our first in Thailand. It was a great event at a beautiful venue. Our Thai hosts at the Centara Grand were wonderfully welcoming and helped to make BKK16 an event to remember.

On Monday 7 March, George Grey, CEO of Linaro, started proceedings with his now traditional [welcome keynote](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpvZ2HwL4zI). He made several announcements including the [ARM Based Developer Cloud](/news/linaro-announces-arm-based-developer-cloud-2/) and [96Boards HiKey in AOSP](/news/linaro-announces-support-for-96boards-hikey-in-aosp/).

**Keynotes**

We were very excited to have had some fantastic keynote speakers that got a lot of engagement from our attendees. Security in a device connected world was a common theme each morning. The message was “Yes we should be very worried about security vulnerabilities in connected devices (light bulbs, thermostats, teddy bears…) and we have a responsibility as engineers to minimize these issues as much as humanly possible. “
