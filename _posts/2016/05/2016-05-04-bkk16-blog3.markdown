## After Dark

As BKK16 was hosted in such a beautiful location, there was no need to look further afield for the perfect setting for the [Linaro Connect party](https://flic.kr/s/aHskvTDhFc). Attendees gathered together in the fabulous Lotus Garden of Centara Grand Hotel at Central World for live music, fabulous food and spectacular views of Bangkok.

The spring Linaro Connect is when we take the opportunity each year to recognise those stand out members of the Linaro community. Yet again there were many names put forward but the following were the winners on the night:

## Demo Friday


We ended a busy week with the always popular Demo Friday. No surprise that many of the demos used a 96Boards platform.  Some of the demos included a DLNA Media Server with multiple clients, AOSP with Freedreno, PlayReady-OPTEE on OpenSDK/B2120 and Portable IO on a Sensors board.
