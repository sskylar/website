The Linaro Connect Las Vegas 2016 (LAS16) was one of the largest Connect events to date. Linaro Connect Las Vegas 2016 (LAS16) was a five-day event full of keynotes by industry leaders, talks, training, hacking and a lot of socializing fun.  Linaro Connect brings together the best and the brightest of the Linux on ARM community and LAS16 was no exception. The week was full of great keynotes each morning covering many different topics in the community. There was an announcement of a new segment group at Linaro, the [Linaro IoT and Embedded Group (LITE)](/news/linaro-announces-lite-collaborative-software-engineering-internet-things-iot/).  The Internet of Things (IoT) is disrupting the traditional embedded market and creating huge growth opportunities. Standards are essential to the success of IoT and the LITE group will bring together ARM ecosystem support for key standards and engineering work to support reliable implementations.

The week of sessions included many different tracks that attendees could attend, with each day focused on a particular segment within Linaro. Along with all the sessions and hacking there was also the traditional demo Friday that was held to showcase all the hard work that was done by the various teams over the last several months. Attendees were able to enjoy lunch while wandering the exhibit hall full of demos by both Linaro and it's member companies.

  * **LAS16-309: Server Ecosystem: Xen on ARM, from Big Iron to IoT & LuaJIT status on Aarch64**

    * Abstract Xen on ARM: The Xen port is exploiting this set of new hardware capabilities to run guest VMs in the most efficient way possible while keeping ARM specific changes to Xen and Linux to a minimum. ARM virtualization is set to be increasingly relevant for the embedded industry in the coming years.Whilst Xen is best known as the technology powering the biggest clouds in the industry, it also a great fit for automotive deployments and mobile devices that can fit in your pocket. The talk will give concrete examples of the ways Xen can add value to your platforms, not only by providing an excellent general purpose virtualization solution, but also by providing simple, yet effective ways to partition the platform into different security domains.
This presentation will include a brief overview of the Xen on ARM architecture, covering the key design principles employed. The techniques pioneered during the ARM port that allowed the Xen community to remove many legacy components from the Xen code base, streamlining both the ARM and x86 implementations. The talk will conclude explaining how to port Xen to any new ARM boards with the least amount of effort.


    * Abstract LuaJIT: Lua is a scripting language commonly embedded by web front-ends. Enabling Lua JIT compilation can reduce CPU usage when handling huge amounts of network traffic. This year Linaro (and others) started to work on porting LuaJIT to AArch64. Though the work is not finished we have made good progress. This presentation will briefly introduce LuaJIT, discuss the technical challenges of porting to AArch64, and address the progress of the porting effort and the next steps.

  * **LAS16-104: MyNewt technical overview**


    * James Pace & Sterling Hughes (Runtime.io) Apache Mynewt is a community-driven, permissively licensed open source initiative for constrained, embedded devices and applications. The emergence of the IoT is proving that anything that can be connected will be. Many of these devices—wristbands and wearables, lightbulbs and locks–must be operated for long periods of time, but are constrained in terms of power, memory, and storage. Apache Mynewt addresses these constraints while remaining hardware agnostic. Apache Mynewt includes the world’s first controller-level open source Bluetooth Low Energy for microcontrollers. Apache Mynewt has 4 main goals: A foundational RTOS and embedded middleware such as boot loaders, file systems / TLV storage, time-series data support; rich instrumentation and logging infrastructure; Solid networking protocol stacks for secure, efficient communications with constrained devices; Simple image and configuration management and instrumentation for ongoing diagnostics, whether at the workbench or in mass deployment; Modularity and easy composability to build an optimized image. This presentation will help developers up and down the stack understand the requirements and challenges of embedded development environments. For embedded developers–whether they are using common maker environments like Arduino or mature product-oriented tools–a fresh approach to permissively licensed open source tools will be presented.

  * **LAS16-405: OpenDataPlane: Software Defined Dataplane leader**


    * You may think OpenDataPlane and DPDK are somewhat equivalent. But they are not. OpenDataPlane is about Software Defined Dataplanes while DPDK is a Software Dataplane. A Software Defined Dataplane can control a hardware only Dataplane in a way that packets can go from input port to output port without reaching a CPU core. With Software Dataplanes , all packets have to reach a CPU core. As a result, one vendor could leverage a Software Defined Dataplane to build a 100Tbps network box while it is not possible with a Software Dataplane.
