Cambridge, UK;  7 March 2016

Linaro Ltd, the collaborative engineering organization developing open source software for the ARM® architecture, today announced that the 96Boards HiKey octa-core 64-bit ARMv8 community board is supported in AOSP (Android Open Source Project). Developers can now download source code from AOSP and create a working build without the need to pull patches from any other repository.

Linaro has worked on AOSP contributions and toolchain optimizations since its establishment in 2010. Over the last five years, Linaro has provided various builds of AOSP for member hardware, but these have all been maintained outside of the AOSP common tree. Moving forward for existing and future versions of Android, Linaro is simplifying its provision of builds and focusing its efforts on getting full support and ongoing maintenance for member hardware into AOSP. Support for the 96Boards HiKey is available now and we expect additional hardware platform support will follow. 

“One of the challenges of developing on AOSP has been the lack of a developer friendly platform combining community hardware with an open source software stack,” said Tom Gall, Director of the Linaro Mobile Group (LMG). “We’re very happy to have been able to have support for the 96Boards HiKey accepted into the AOSP common tree and look forward to enabling developers.”

Information about the HiKey board and Running Android on HiKey are available here: [http://source.android.com/source/devices.html](http://source.android.com/source/devices.html). Linaro is providing instructions for developers here: [http://linaro.co/hikey-start](http://linaro.co/hikey-start)  and the hardware platform can be purchased from Lenovator ([http://linaro.co/hikey-lenovator-buy](http://linaro.co/hikey-lenovator-buy)) and seeed ([http://linaro.co/hikey-seeed-buy](http://linaro.co/hikey-seeed-buy)).
