## Linaro has joined the Open Compute Project (OCP) as an official member and contributes the LAVA LMP (Linaro Multi-purpose probe) to the foundation


Linaro, the not-for-profit engineering organization developing open source software for the ARM® architecture, today announced that it has joined the Open Compute Project (OCP), an initiative launched by Facebook in 2011 to increase technology efficiencies and reduce the environmental impact of data centers.

OCP applies open-source software principles to the hardware industry to drive the development of the most efficient computing infrastructures at the lowest possible cost. Working with partners in both the hardware and software industries, it strives to achieve further innovation and efficiencies in scale computing technology.In parallel, Linaro – in particular within the Linaro Enterprise Group (LEG) – has become the place where a similar cross-section of companies collaborate on the future of Linux software on ARM-based servers. Linaro’s intention in joining OCP is to bring together the hardware and software discussion and help accelerate the release of more efficient server solutions. It will also contribute the specifications of the LAVA Multi-purpose Probe (LMP) to be made available through OCP. LMP boards extend the testing options for hardware incorporated into the Linaro Automated Validation Architecture (LAVA) test framework, which is available as an open source project.

“We’re excited to welcome Linaro into the Open Compute Project,” said Cole Crawford, executive director of the Open Compute Foundation. “The organization’s commitment to developing core open source software in a collaborative and transparent environment matches our own mission of openly sharing ideas and specifications to accelerate innovation in pursuit of the most efficient data center infrastructure.”

“We’ve been working closely with OCP since the founding of the Linaro Enterprise Group and the synergies between hardware and software in this space are very exciting,” said George Grey, Linaro CEO. “We’re very happy to be formally joining OCP and bringing the benefits of LAVA and LMP to a broader audience.”

About Linaro

Linaro is the place where engineers from the world’s leading technology companies define the future of Linux on ARM. The company is a not-for-profit engineering organization with over 140 engineers working on consolidating and optimizing open source software for the ARM architecture, including developer tools, the Linux kernel, ARM power management, and other software infrastructure. Linaro is distribution neutral: it wants to provide the best software foundations to everyone, and to reduce non-differentiating and costly low level fragmentation.

To ensure commercial quality software, Linaro’s work includes comprehensive test and validation on member hardware platforms. The full scope of Linaro’s engineering work is open to all online. To find out more, please visit .
