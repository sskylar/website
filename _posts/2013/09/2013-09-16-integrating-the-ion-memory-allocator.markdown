description: At the 2013 Linux Plumbers conference we'll be discussing the ION memory
  allocator and how its functionality might be upstreamed to the mainline kernel during
  the Android + Graphics micro-conference. I wanted to create some background documentation
  to try to provide context to the issues we will discuss and try to resolve at the
  micro-conference so I wrote an article for LWN to give more detail.
