Linaro, the not-for-profit engineering organization which works to consolidate   and optimize open source Linux software and tools for the ARM   architecture, together with its members, partners and community are growing and influencing many areas of the ARM ecosystem and as such its women in technology footprint is growing well.

At this Connect event, we took a moment to not only take [a group photo](/blog/linaro-connect-asia-2013-group-photo/) to mark the participation in our event, but we also took a Women in Technology photo to capture how women's participation within the Linaro Community is growing.
