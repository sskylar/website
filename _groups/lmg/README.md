# Linaro Mobile Group (LMG)

Linaro was founded by companies focused on working together in the mobile space. As Linaro’s work broadened beyond mobile, discussions in the Technical Steering Committee (TSC) similarly broadened and towards the end of 2013, a mobile sub-committee (MOBSCOM) was formed to deal with mobile discussions in more detail. In July 2014, this sub-committee was replaced by the Linaro Mobile Group (LMG) and its associated steering committee (LMG-SC). Information about LMG is available on the Linaro wiki: https://wiki.linaro.org/LMG.

Linaro’s mission in the mobile space has always been to collaborate with members to consolidate and optimize open source software for mobile platforms on ARM. The mobile space includes all types of phones, tablets, laptops and wearables. Android has been identified as the primary mobile OS on which Linaro’s work in this area is tested, but other options, including Chrome OS, Firefox OS and Tizen have been discussed and could be brought in if members decided there was a need.

The LMG engineering team has an established reputation for optimizing Android components, performing bring up using new kernels and new toolchains, upstreaming AOSP patches to the open source community and developing new technology. The team released the first port of the Android Open Source Project (AOSP) for ARM’s new 64-bit Juno hardware development platform in July 2014.
