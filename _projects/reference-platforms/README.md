# Reference Platforms

The goal of the [Reference Platforms](https://platforms.linaro.org/) Lead Project is to create reference end to end open source software releases for ARM SoCs in applications ranging from the Embedded to Enterprise segments. The releases comprise bootloader, kernel, distribution and user level middleware/applications. The intention is to make available reference source code, documentation on building the source code and any hardware dependencies including porting guide for other SoCs, and details about configurations chosen for the reference builds.

The Reference Platform releases on their tested hardware are product quality. The tested hardware includes member SoCs, 96Boards products and may include some other third-party platforms. For further information, please visit [platforms.linaro.org](https://platforms.linaro.org/)
