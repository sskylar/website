# ARM Kernel Collaboration

Collaboration with Linaro and Member companies on upstreaming key common kernel features beneficial to the ARM Ecosystem.

**The sources of the features could include:**

- Common out of tree code from member deliverables
- New or updated specifications from standards organizations such as USB, MMC, PCI, etc
- Refactoring of common sub-systems to reduce duplication of board and architecture specific code
- Champion new technologies to prevent fragmentation

**Key Deliverables:**

- Tool to analyze kernel source code base version against shipped product source
- Analysis of member product code bases for common issues
- Regular prioritized list of areas to be improved upstream & successes
- Consideration for LSK inclusion of code produced prior to completion of upstreaming

**Useful Information:**

- Governance: [Linaro Technical Steering Committee](https://wiki.linaro.org/Internal/TSC) (MEMBERS ONLY)
- Mailing lists: Linaro Kernel for any internal Linaro discussion, upstream engineering on [Device Mainlining](http://lists.linuxfoundation.org/mailman/listinfo/device-mainlining)
- Engineering: [Kernel Engineering Wiki](https://wiki.linaro.org/WorkingGroups/Kernel)
- JIRA Project: [Project Summary](https://projects.linaro.org/projects/KWG/summary), [JIRA Board](https://projects.linaro.org/secure/RapidBoard.jspa?projectKey=KWG&rapidView=30), [JIRA Structure](https://projects.linaro.org/secure/StructureBoard.jspa?s=101)
