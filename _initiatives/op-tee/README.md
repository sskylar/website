# OP-TEE

OP-TEE stands for Open Portable Trusted Execution Environment. The project has
roots in a proprietary solution, initially created by ST-Ericsson and then owned
and maintained by STMicroelectronics. In 2014, Linaro started working with
STMicroelectronics to transform the proprietary TEE solution into an open source
TEE solution instead. In September 2015, the ownership was transferred to
Linaro. Today it is one of the key security projects in Linaro, with several of
Linaro’s members supporting and using it.

The [optee_os] git, contains the source code for the TEE in Linux using the ARM®
TrustZone® technology. This component meets the GlobalPlatform TEE Client API
for the communication with the TEE and GlobalPlatform TEE Internal Core API
specifications for the Trusted Applications.
